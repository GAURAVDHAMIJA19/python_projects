This project is a simple yet insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a movie dataset using Python. The main objective is to clean the raw data and uncover meaningful patterns and trends using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. After handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies, the dataset was analyzed to explore various features such as movie genres,  runtime, and user ratings.  This project demonstrates how basic data analysis tools can be used to extract valuable information from real-world datasets in an easy and effective way.
